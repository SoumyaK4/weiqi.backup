    I've created This Roadmap in 2021 from my experience of becoming an Intermediate Level Player, <br>
    With Just 1 Year of Self Studies, using online free resources.<br />
    I hope this helps you on Your Journey as well. <br>
    <b>Good Luck, Have Fun!!</b>

**Start at the top and as your rank increases, slowly move down <br>to find more relevant things to learn/do.**
