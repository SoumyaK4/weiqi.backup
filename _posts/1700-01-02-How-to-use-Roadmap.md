I created this Roadmap back in 2021, drawing from my journey of becoming a Dan Level Go Player. <br>
With just one year of self-study and free online resources, I achieved this milestone. <br>
This roadmap is here to guide you on your own journey. <br>
<b>And as we always say before starting our games, Good Luck, Have Fun!!</b>
</h5>
