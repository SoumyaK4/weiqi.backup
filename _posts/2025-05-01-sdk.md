## Mastering the SDK Levels

---

Navigating through the SDK ranks requires patience, practice, and persistence. Use this roadmap to stay focused and motivated on your path to improvement:

### **[From 9 Kyu to 7 Kyu](/posts/sdk-9kyu)**

At this level, honing your fundamentals is key. Learn how to balance influence and territory, improve your reading skills, and start experimenting with more advanced joseki.

### **[From 6 Kyu to 3 Kyu](/posts/sdk-6kyu)**  

The mid-SDK levels challenge you to refine your middle-game tactics and strengthen your endgame strategies. Focus on whole-board thinking and begin to integrate more complex life-and-death problems into your study routine.

### **[Approaching Dan - From 3 Kyu Onward](/posts/sdk-3kyu)**  

As you close in on Dan level, the game becomes more about precision and consistency. Advanced tesuji, deep reading, and an intuitive understanding of shape will help you bridge the gap.

## [Dan and Beyond](/posts/weiqi-resources)

Your journey doesn’t stop here! Advancing to Shodan (1 Dan) is a significant milestone that requires a deeper understanding of Go principles, unwavering focus, and regular practice. [Check out the Dan-level roadmap](/posts/weiqi-resources) (work in progress) for more insights.
