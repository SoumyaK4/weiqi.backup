## What is This Game?
<hr>

It is an ancient abstract-strategy board game for two players. <br>
The game from its forgotten origins in China, spread first to the rest of East Asia, and then to the entire world.

> _Itâ€™s the most infinite board game we know of, which has made conquering it the holy grail of AI research. In fact,
human professional players used to be considered unbeatable by computers because they played on intuition, which
computers just couldnâ€™t do until in 2016, when Google's DeepMind created AlphaGo._

How ancient? Historians aren't sure; it has a definite <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoryOfGo" target="_blank">
  history</a> of over 3000 years, but according to tradition Go was invented more than 4000 years ago and is believed to
be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day without fundamental changes to the main rules/concepts.

> Many Names for the Game: <br>
The English name comes from the Japanese name Igo, which means "Surrounding Board Game".
Baduk in Korean and Weiqi (pronounced: Wei-Chi) in Chinese.

In this game, each player tries to use threats of death, capture, or isolation to assert control over more of the board
than their opponent - an abstract strategy game at heart.

Go has nonetheless been interpreted as a stylized representation of fighting a war, settling a frontier, cornering a
market, thrashing out an argument, or even of fortune-telling and prophecy.

> The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1Ã—10^170, which is far greater
than the number of atoms in the observable universe.

  target='_blank'>Hikaru no Go</a>, released in Japan in 1998(Manga) / 2001(Anime), had a large contribution in
popularizing Go among young players, both in Japan and internationally as translations were published abroad.

> Synopsys: One day a Japanese sixth grader named Shindo Hikaru discovers an old Go board in his grandfatherâ€™s attic.
Inside that old board there lives a ghost that only he can see.

> Honestly I think most of us amateur players got interested in the game because of this series.
