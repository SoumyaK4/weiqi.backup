## Play More GO!!

At this point its honestly good enough to reach 1 Kyu. All you need to do is keep eliminating your bad habits. Try to change your style sometimes, it gives a fresh perspective and makes you much stronger in the long run. <br>
And anything on this page is still under construction. 
As I'm yet to become a solid dan player. I have just been enjoying all my games since I reached 1dan, changed up my playing style quite a few times since 2022 and dropping a few ranks and climbing back to 1kyu again. <br>

> There's still a ton of lectures on specefic topics I need to add, but I'm just being lazy!!!

but do check out the Lectures by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=in+seong+hwang+go+lectures" target="_blank">In-Seong Hwang</a>. I love his lectures.
