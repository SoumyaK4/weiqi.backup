## Work in Progress

This roadmap is constantly evolving as I refine my own journey to becoming a solid dan player. Since reaching 1 Dan, I’ve experimented with various styles, dropped ranks, and climbed back up to 1 Kyu.  
> There’s still more to add—specific lectures and niche techniques—but for now, enjoy the resources here.
