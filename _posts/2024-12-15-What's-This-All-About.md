## What Is the Game of Go?

---

Go is an ancient abstract strategy board game for two players, celebrated for its simplicity and depth. From its almost forgotten origins in China, it journeyed across East Asia before capturing the imagination of players worldwide.

> _"It’s the most infinite board game we know of, which has made it the holy grail of AI research. For decades, human professionals dominated Go until 2016, when Google's DeepMind unveiled AlphaGo, an AI that redefined intuition in gameplay."_

### How Ancient Is It?

Historians confirm <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoryOfGo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
Go’s history</a> stretches over 3,000 years. However, traditional accounts suggest it could be more than 4,000 years old, making it the oldest continuously played board game with unchanged core rules.

### Many Names, One Game.

Go’s name varies across cultures, mainly:
- **Igo** in Japanese (“surrounding board game”)
- **Baduk** in Korean
- **Weiqi** in Chinese (pronounced "Wei-Chi")

### Gameplay in a Nutshell.

Go is about territory. Players use strategies like capture, isolation, and control to dominate the board. While abstract at heart, the game has been interpreted as a metaphor for war, frontier settlement, market domination, and even prophecy.

> "The number of legal board positions in Go is estimated at **2.1×10^170**" — far greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe.
